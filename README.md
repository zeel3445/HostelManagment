The purpose of “HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipments and full- fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer  period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. The organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. That means one need not be distracted by information that is not relevant, while being able to reach information.
So, HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM deals with maintenance of records of details of each student who has reserved a hostel for his stay. It also includes maintenance of information of each hostel. Working of the HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM involves many operations, which have to be  done manually. It takes a lot of time and causes many disputes with staff and students. To solve this problem, and further for maintaining the record of hostels, students, availability of hostels, price for each hostel and other things, we are proposing this proposal of HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM .By using this software, we can allocate hostels to the students. This project checks all sorts of constraints so that the user does give only useful data and validation is done in an effective way.

FUNCTIONALITY:
Once the student is enrolled in college his/her USN and Password is  shared to Hostel management and they add up to their database. If students wants to apply for a hostel then  
He/she needs to fill a form which comprises of general details like name, aadhaar_number, parent’s detail , etc. after filling the form the ball is in management court(i.e ADMIN) then the admin will decide to whom which hostel and room should be allocated .when the process of allocation is done then data is updated into their database.

Now only ADMIN has power to see the Database ,and for the same he has been provided with multiple options-

•	He can check multiple checkboxes of attributes of different relations to get the desired details.
•	 He can write his own SQL query along with some remark and then run it, he will get the required output and concurrently this query and corresponding remark will updated into another relation.
•	After updation of query and remark into the relation ,now we can fetch the same query anytime without writing it again with its remark using a dropdown menu.
